# Distance Field Workshop

These are supplementary resources for a workshop I gave at GenArtHackParty #004 in August 2017. 

Each file example-000.glsl, example-001.glsl, etc. builds on the previous as we start
to build a very basic ray-marcher in GLSL.

Each can be pasted directly into [The Book of Shaders Editor](http://editor.thebookofshaders.com/)

Unfortunately this repo is not stand-alone, as the education part involves me
waving my hands in front of a whiteboard.
